Hi there!

This is the final (well... as final as I could make it) version of my very first game, developed at the end of Module ! of the Ironhack Bootcamp. Shaping up this bundle of code has been quite a ride, so thank you for joining me.

This game is an iteration on what I would call the "droplet-collector" genre, where one or many players have to collect items shown onscreen by touching them to score points. This genre usually includes harmful consumables that either decrease the points of the players, its health... or even kills the player!

I didn't want to make my game so dramatic, so I settled on a variant of harmful droplets that would decrease the player's points. Therefore the player can win by avoiding those droplets, and if enough droplets are hit, the score depletes and the player loses.

Even with an input like that, the game could become too easy. That's why this game is set for 2 players, so that both of them have to compete for the same amount of helpful droplets. Thus, the difficulty does not come from the game itself, but from the skills of the rival player.

Graphically, I went for a 2D retro look, since it resonates with audiences of all ages and it is easy to render and animate. With more time, or if I give this game a remake in the future, I would like to draw my own sprites, to add a personal touch.

If you want to test this game, grab a friend and play along- it will be more fun that way.


The rules are simple:

- Player one moves with keys Left.
- Player two moves with A, D.
- The apples give the players +10 points, the burgers take 10 points away.
- The first player to reach 100 points wins!
