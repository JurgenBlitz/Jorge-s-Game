Hi there!

This is a placeholder for the full version of my game. Well, my very first programmed game! Shaping up these pieces of code has been quite a ride, so I tank you for joining me.

This game is an iteration on what I would call the "droplet-collector" genre, where one or many players have to collect items shown onscreen by touching them to score points. This genre usually includes harmful consumables that either decrease the points of the players, its health... or even kills the player!

I didn't want to make my game so dramatically, so I settled on a variant of harmful droplets that would decrease the player's points. Therefore the player can win by avoiding those droplets, and if enough droplets are hit, the score depletes and the player loses.

Even with an input like that, the game could become too easy. That's why, ideally, this game will be set for 2 players, so that both of them have to compete for the same amount of helpful droplets.

I'd go ahead and describe the graphic aspect of the game- but we will cross that bridge when we get to it.
